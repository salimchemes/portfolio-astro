Do you often need to open the same URL in different environments? I created a Chrome extension to simplify this process for you. With this extension, you can open the current URL in a new tab, replacing only the host URL while keeping the rest of the path intact.

When is this helpful?
This extension is particularly useful when you're working on localhost and need to open the exact same URL in another environment, such as a staging or production server.

Give it a try
