One of the most complicated things on reactive development is to understand how rxjs operators work.
It's is very common scenario to don't recognize which is the best operator to implement based on your needs.

The first step is to know the types. So before selecting an operator it was helpful for me identify to which type belongs to. You can take a look to the types [here](https://www.learnrxjs.io/learn-rxjs/operators)

There are many great resources to learn rxjs. Anyway, the best (probably the only) way to fully understand is practice, practice and more practice.

**Instead of creating a post with examples and only theory content, I have created a simple app that allows you to navigate types and operators with code snippets.**

This is what I've used to build the application:
* netlify
* [github](https://github.com/salimchemes/rxjs-operators)
* [ngx-highlightjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ngx-highlightjs): code snippets
* [ngx-json-viewer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ngx-json-viewer): json formatter
* docs: [learnrxjs](https://www.learnrxjs.io/) and [rxjs](https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/)
* videos: [Top 10 RxJs Operators in Angular](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TnWFaI49aw&t=525s&ab_channel=DavidAcosta)

*Disclaimer: I did not include all rxjs operators, just some of them. Some examples are in progress I will continue adding more details*
