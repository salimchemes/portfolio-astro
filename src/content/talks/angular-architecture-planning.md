We have to plan and design our application and it is time to make many decisions and prioritize. We know that our business is complex and it is important to balance the technical decisions and requirements of our client.

How do I start? What is the simplest way to organize our project? How do I define my components / services? Which stage management strategy is best for my need? How do I avoid overkill? The unit test? Do we add Automation tests? And the security? Local logging, in the cloud or both?

We will share different experiences and alternatives based on our needs to make the best decisions
