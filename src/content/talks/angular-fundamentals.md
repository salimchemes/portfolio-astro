Montevideo, Uruguay
We listen and read, in blogs, social networks, etc., more and more terms like: web applications, mobile apps, developments responsive, javascript frameworks, full stack developers, backend and frontend. You have to start modeling a professional profile and it is best to try to know all the edges by which you can walk in a profession like ours. That is why we will be showing you a technology that includes many of these terms we listed before: Angular.

What is Angular? What is this for? How can we start a project with this framework? We will share basic concepts about the framework like:

Components
Modules
Directives
Services (DI)
Finally, we will build an app and run it live.
